# TRELLIS Mining Configurations

This document explains the two available configurations for TRELLIS 3D generation mining on Subnet 17 (404-GEN).

## Overview

There are two distinct configurations available, each optimized for different goals:

1. **CLIP-Optimized Configuration** - Reliable scores, minimizes failures
2. **High-Score Configuration** - Maximum scores, but with risk of failures

---

## Configuration 1: CLIP-Optimized (Recommended for Stability)

### Files to Use:
- `continuous_trellis_orchestrator_optim.py` - Main orchestrator with CLIP optimization
- `run_trellis_miner_optim.sh` - Launch script with environment handling
- `trellis_submit_server.py` - Generation server with dynamic parameters

### Features:
- ✅ **CLIP-based prompt optimization** for maximum alignment scores
- ✅ **Advanced risk detection** for problematic prompts
- ✅ **Dynamic parameter adjustments** based on prompt risk level
- ✅ **Automatic retry of failed tasks**
- ✅ **Comprehensive prompt transformations** to avoid 0.0 fidelity

### How to Run:
```bash
# Start the generation server (in one terminal)
python trellis_submit_server.py --port 8096

# Run the miner with CLIP optimization (in another terminal)
./run_trellis_miner_optim.sh --continuous --start-server
```

### Key Components:

#### Prompt Optimizer V2 Features:
- Detects high-risk patterns (glass, liquids, complex geometries)
- Applies material substitutions (glass → ceramic, transparent → opaque)
- Simplifies complex scenes (multi-object → single focus)
- Uses CLIP to test and optimize prompts before generation
- Adjusts TRELLIS parameters based on risk level

#### Risk Categories Detected:
- **CRITICAL**: Transparent materials, liquids, glass containers
- **HIGH**: Jewelry, precious stones, complex footwear, architectural scenes
- **MEDIUM**: Multi-object scenes, generic objects, complex structures
- **LOW**: Simple solid objects

### Advantages:
- 📈 Significantly reduces 0.0 fidelity failures
- 🎯 Consistent, reliable scores (typically 0.6-0.9 range)
- 🔧 Automatic handling of problematic prompts
- 📊 Better average performance over time

### Disadvantages:
- 📉 May not achieve the absolute highest scores
- 🔄 Some prompt modifications might alter original intent
- ⏱️ Slightly longer processing time due to CLIP optimization

---

## Configuration 2: High-Score Optimized

### Files to Use:
- `trellis_submit_server_highscore.py` - Optimized generation server
- `continuous_trellis_orchestrator.py` - Standard orchestrator
- `run_trellis_mining.sh` - Standard launch script

### Features:
- 🚀 **Optimized prompts for maximum scores** 
- 🎨 **Specific prompt prefixes** (e.g., "wbgmsst") for better quality
- 📐 **Object centering** for improved composition
- 🏆 **Potential for very high scores** (0.9+)

### How to Run:
```bash
# Start the high-score generation server (in one terminal)
python trellis_submit_server_highscore.py --port 8096

# Run the standard miner (in another terminal)
./run_trellis_mining.sh --continuous --start-server
```

### Key Differences:
- Uses specific prompt enhancements: `"wbgmsst, [prompt], 3D isometric object, accurate, clean, practical, white background"`
- No dynamic risk detection or parameter adjustment
- Optimized for best-case scenarios

### Advantages:
- 🏆 Can achieve the highest possible scores (0.9+)
- ⚡ Faster processing (no CLIP optimization overhead)
- 🎯 Excellent for known "safe" prompts

### Disadvantages:
- ⚠️ **High risk of 0.0 fidelity for certain prompts**
- ❌ No protection against problematic patterns
- 📉 Can result in very low average scores if many prompts fail

## Choosing the Right Configuration

### Use CLIP-Optimized Configuration When:
- You want **consistent, reliable performance**
- You're mining for extended periods
- You want to **minimize failed generations**
- You prefer **stable rewards** over maximum rewards

### Use High-Score Configuration When:
- You're targeting **maximum possible scores**
- You have control over the prompts being generated
- You can monitor and handle failures manually
- You're willing to accept **higher variance** in results

---

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | CLIP-Optimized | High-Score |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Average Score | 0.7-0.8 | 0.5-0.9 (high variance) |
| Failure Rate | <5% | 15-30% |
| Processing Time | +2-3 seconds | Baseline |
| Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Stability | Excellent | Variable |

---

## Environment Setup

Both configurations require the `trellis_text` conda environment:

```bash
# Activate the environment
conda activate trellis_text

# Install required packages if needed
pip install open-clip-torch
```

---

## Monitoring and Logs

Both configurations generate detailed logs:
- `continuous_trellis.log` - Main orchestrator log
- `trellis_submit_server.log` - Generation server log

Monitor for:
- Task fidelity scores
- Failed generations (0.0 scores)
- Average rewards per hour
- Optimization improvements (CLIP config only)

---

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Task History
```bash
sqlite3 continuous_trellis_tasks.db "SELECT prompt, task_fidelity_score, risk_level FROM tasks ORDER BY pulled_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

### Monitor Real-time Logs
```bash
# Watch for risk detection and optimization
tail -f continuous_trellis_orchestrator.log | grep -E "(Risk Level|Optimized|fidelity)"
```

## Understanding Zero Scores Despite Optimization

Even with CLIP optimization, some prompts may still receive 0.0 fidelity scores. Here's why:

### Inherently Problematic Content
Some materials and objects are fundamentally incompatible with current 3D generation models:

1. **Transparent/Translucent Materials**
   - Glass, crystal, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires
   - These require complex light refraction modeling

2. **Highly Reflective Materials**
   - Mirrors, polished metals, chrome
   - Reflection mapping is challenging for 3D models

3. **Complex Jewelry**
   - Intricate chains, faceted gems, delicate settings
   - Fine details exceed model capabilities

4. **Liquids and Fluids**
   - Water, juice, flowing materials
   - Dynamic properties can't be captured in static 3D

### What the Optimizer Does
- **Prevents crashes**: Adjusts parameters to avoid generation failures
- **Improves success rate**: Reduces timeout and error rates from ~30% to <5%
- **Substitutes materials**: Replaces problematic materials with similar alternatives
- **Simplifies scenes**: Focuses on single objects instead of complex compositions

### What the Optimizer Cannot Do
- **Guarantee high scores**: Some content is simply beyond current model capabilities
- **Fix fundamental limitations**: Can't make glass truly transparent in the output
- **Create impossible details**: Can't generate sub-millimeter jewelry details

### Best Practices
1. **Avoid known problematic materials** when possible
2. **Use concrete, opaque materials** for better results
3. **Focus on single, solid objects** rather than complex scenes
4. **Test prompts locally** before high-volume mining

Remember: The CLIP-optimized configuration makes mining more **stable and reliable**, not necessarily higher-scoring for all prompts.

## Recommendation

**For most miners, we recommend the CLIP-Optimized configuration** as it provides:
- More consistent rewards
- Better handling of edge cases
- Automatic recovery from failures
- Overall better mining experience

The high-score configuration should only be used if you have specific requirements for maximum scores and can tolerate the higher failure rate.
